### About the game of War: This game is the card game of war. This game uses all 52 cards and deals them evenly between two players. They turn their cards at the same time face up. The highest card played wins, and the winner collects cards. If there is a tie, war breaks out, and three cards are dealt on the fourth card, flip and see who has the highest and wins all cards played. The winner is who collects all 52 cards. 

### I chose this game because it was one of my favorites as a child, and I wanted to theme it around the office. I hope you enjoy it!
